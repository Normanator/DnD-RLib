Description: A set of utility functions for Dungeons and Dragons.
    Functions include dice-rolling of various combinations of dice-sizes,
    modeling Advantage and Disadvantage, best M of N rolls, etc.
    Plotting of die roll distributions helps visualize the effects of
    upgrades, buffs, etc.
    Challenge-rating utils help you create encounters for a party.
    Most die-roll statistics functions should be agnostic to
    Dungeons and Dragons version,  but 5th Edition was targeted
    (particularly for encounter challenge utilities).
